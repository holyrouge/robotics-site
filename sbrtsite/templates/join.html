      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      If you have a passion for robotics, engineering, and hands-on learning, join us at our weekly
      General Body Meetings (GBM) to learn about what we do, how to get involved, and how you can contribute
      to our projects. The GBM time and location for 2019 - 2020 is to be determined.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      You can also visit us during our lab hours and build sessions throughout the week. We are constantly
      learning about new topics, planning new projects, and developing our robots. The Fall 2019
      lab hours and build sessions calendar is to be determined.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      When looking for new members, what we look for most are passion
      and dedication. <b>Experience is not necessary!</b> We love people who love robots and love to be
      involved. If you've had previous experience, that is a bonus, but only really important if you
      wish to take a leadership role.

    <p class="col-md-12"></p>
    <p class="col-md-12"><strong>Technical Projects</strong></p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that requires collaboration between people with a diverse
      set of skills, from mechanical fabrication to computer vision. Regardless of what you are passionate
      about and what you want to achieve, there will be ample opportunity to take on interesting challenges
      and learn something new.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      For the past several years, our team has designed and built several robots, including a <b>Mars Rover</b>
      and a <b>Combat Robot</b>. This year, our team will be focusing on a brand-new <b>Self-driving Car</b> competition
      and the <b>Mars Rover</b> project, with positions open across all of our engineering teams, including some
      leadership roles.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12"></p>
    <p class="col-md-12"><strong>Business Endeavors</strong></p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      Running a large, diverse, and passionate team requires a strong business side to support all of our projects
      and mission. Students with entrepreneurial inclinations are encouraged to join. Positions are open in
      <b>Sponsorship</b> and <b>Public Relations</b> teams. It is also possible to have secondary roles in technical
      design teams.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12"></p>
    <p class="col-md-12"><strong>Lab Access</strong></p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      To access our lab spaces, all members are required to complete several safety courses that will teach the basics
      of lab safety. The required courses are: <b>ENV 001 (Hazardous Waste)</b>, <b>ELS 002 (Lab Safety - Chemical
        Hazards)</b>,
      and <b>EOS 029 (Machine Shop Safety)</b>. All of these courses are taken through Blackboard and do not affect your
      transcript.
      They are solely to certify you to be in the lab spaces.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      Please provide us with printed copies of the signed <b>Machine Shop Safety Agreement</b>, and your <b>grades</b>
      from all
      three courses to gain access to the lab spaces. You can provide them to us during our GBMs, lab hours, or build
      sessions.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      The following <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bS-S0LO5mZprRszaVG8YWqNEmbic10kCVQhFMSv4V6I/edit?usp=sharing"
        target="_blank">link</a> will guide you through the process of completing the safety courses
      and providing the required documentation. <b>Please follow the directions carefully!</b>
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      If you have taken one or more of these courses previously, you do not need to retake them. Please follow the
      guidelines in the
      above linked document to provide the required documentation before accessing the lab spaces.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12"></p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      <b>General Lab Rules</b>
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      1. No shorts, skirts, etc. Long pants only!
      <br />
      2. No open-toed shoes (such as sandals, flip-flops, etc.). Closed-toed shoes such as sneakers and boots only!

      While these are a list of the basic rules you should follow, a more extensive list of rules that you must follow
      is provided
      in the <b>Machine Shop Safety Agreement</b>, a signed copy of which is required to gain access to the lab spaces.

    <p class="col-md-12">
      <b>1. How can I find out more about joining the Stony Brook Robotics Team?</b>
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      During September, we will be hosting several info-sessions in classes, where we will
      give an overview of the team, our upcoming projects, and ways to get involved. Also, feel
      free to approach our team members during the USG Involvement Fair, the CEAS Involvement Fair,
      or after the info-sessions for any specific questions. You can also attend our beginning of
      the semester GBMs, where we will give an introduction to the team. For any specific dates,
      times, and locations of our info-sessions and GBMs, follow us at <a
        href="https://www.instagram.com/sbroboticsteam" target="_blank">@sbroboticsteam</a>!
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12"></p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      <b>2. Can I join the Stony Brook Robotics Team if I have no experience?</b>
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      Absolutely! We are dedicated to providing our members with skills and experience necessary to succeed.
      Our mentorship program, workshops, and annual Internal Competition will help you get started by teaching you
      the fundamentals of robotics, engineering, and more!
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12"></p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      <b>3. What if I am not ready to commit to the Stony Brooks Robotics Team this semester?</b>
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      No problem! We are always looking for passionate and dedicated students to join us. You can generally join us
      and get involved during any semester. We will also be hosting a series of introductory robotics workshops
      throughout
      the year. This may be a good opportunity to learn more and see if robotics is the field for you.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12"></p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      <b>4. What is the time commitment necessary to be part of the Stony Brook Robotics Team?</b>
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      While we do not have any time commitment requirements, we encourage all of our members to dedicate
      as much as they feel is necessary to accomplish their tasks. All of our projects happen because our
      dedicated members are excited and passionate about the work that they do. We hope that you too
      will feel the same about the projects that you participate in.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12"></p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      <b>5. Can I be part of multiple engineering teams, such as electrical and mechanical, or multiple projects at the
        same time?</b>
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-12">
      Certainly! While we do encourage our members to take their workload into account before making a commitment,
      you have the freedom to be part of as many engineering teams and projects as you wish, if you feel you are
      capable of making the necessary time commitment.
